# Diabetes_Prediction
- Built an interactive platform to predict diabetes using ML algorithms, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset.
- Evaluated multiple algorithms including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests, selecting the model with the highest accuracy and precision.
- The objective of the project is to predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset.  
- Technologies Used: Python, leveraging libraries such as Scikit-Learn, Pandas, and NumPy for data processing and model development.
